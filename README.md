# Steps to creating a web API

1. Create an API using an express application created in file 
(app.js). Use its built in middleware functions to handle routing, HTTP Requests/Responses, parsing JSON data, and server logging.

2. Establish a connection to the database in file (server.js) and log that the server is up and running.

3. Create routes for express application in user-routes.js file and Set up each route for basic HTTP Methods/Operations.
